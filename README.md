### MVC E-Commerce Platform for Interview
----

Demo code for a job interview. This is a custom MVC framework designed to meet interview objectives, which include not using any existing libraries and demonstration of OOP and design patterns to include EAV schema. Framework architecture is far from production quality and was written quickly so is definitely not perfect.

Currently this project is incomplete, but is being pushed to Github for review, versioning, and code backup.
